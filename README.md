Project report PDF contains the written report for this project.

All code for the project is stored in the project code Jupyter notebook.

The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model to predict credit card default based on payment history and other demographic features.

First, the data is loaded from a CSV file obtained from Kaggle.com and loaded into a Pandas data frame.

Second, the data is cleaned and analysed to gain a better understanding of each feature.

Third, completing exploratory data analysis, the data is split into testing and training sets and cross-validation is performed.

Finally, using the best parameters from the cross-validation, the model is run on the test data and metrics are measured on the performance. Feature importance is extracted and analysed.
